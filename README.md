This example demonstrates a potential issue with Elixir's `Enum.each` function when combined with `Process.exit`.  The `Process.exit` call inside the anonymous function halts the process unexpectedly, which can be a problem if one is expecting `Enum.each` to handle exceptions more gracefully like `Enum.map` would.  The solution explores using `try-catch` or alternatives like `Enum.map` for better error handling.
